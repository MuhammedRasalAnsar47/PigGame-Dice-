## Description

Pig Game is a simple two-player dice game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game offers an engaging experience where players take turns rolling a dice and making strategic decisions to accumulate points while avoiding the risk of losing them.

## Rules of the Game

Each turn, a player rolls a dice and accumulates points.

The player can decide to "hold" and end their turn, adding the current turn's points to their total score.

Rolling a 1 will reset the current turn's points to zero, and the turn passes to the other player.

The first player to score 100 or more points wins the game.

    Alternate turns with the other player until one player reaches or exceeds 100 points.
